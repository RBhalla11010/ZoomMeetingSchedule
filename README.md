# ZoomMeetingSchedule
Asks user the required details(Title, date, timings etc) at run time and sets up invitation or meeting accordingly.
For now, user should login to his zoom account already and then schedule meeting using this code(This feature can be added according to requirements).
Date is asked in specific format in this code which can also be changed according to requirements(annotations have been added in main.xaml for more clarity).
Automation for fun!
